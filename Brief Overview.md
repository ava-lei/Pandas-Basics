# Pandas-Basics
the code uses the Pandas library along with Numpy methods in Python language to solve some interesting dataframe-related problems and contains the following procedures:

create dataframe | select protions of dataframe (row/column) | use numpy mehodsto operate/find information in dataframe | create arrays and operate data

this piece more specifically focuses on creating a dataframe from the data; selecting objects that has certain attribute values and/or satisfies certain conditions comparing attribute values with another attribute values or with a given number; getting the number of unique attribute values in a column; constructing dataframe from series and calculating the mean grouped by types of objects; getting indices of sorted elements of an array and checking certain conditions of an array; reversing the array and printing both versions; getting the top values of an array; setting boundaries to calculations; swapping columns and/or rows in an array
